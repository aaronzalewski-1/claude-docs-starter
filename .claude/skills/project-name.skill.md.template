# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Development

## Overview

<!-- Brief description of your project and what this skill covers -->
{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

**Before any code modifications, read the relevant reference file for your task type.**

## Mandatory Pre-Work

<!--
  Link to your project documentation. This ensures Claude reads context before acting.
  Adjust paths to match your actual documentation structure.
-->

| Task Type | Required Reading |
|-----------|------------------|
| Database/Schema changes | `docs/CLAUDE/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| API endpoint changes | `docs/CLAUDE/API-REFERENCE.md` |
| Any architectural recommendations | `docs/CLAUDE/ARCHITECTURE.md` (read FIRST) |
| Debugging issues | `docs/CLAUDE/DEVELOPMENT.md` |

## Locked Architectural Decisions

<!--
  CRITICAL SECTION
  ================
  Document decisions that have been made and should NOT be questioned or re-litigated.
  This prevents Claude from repeatedly suggesting alternatives to settled decisions.

  Format each decision with:
  - What the decision IS
  - Why it was made (briefly)
  - What NOT to recommend as alternatives
-->

These decisions have been made and MUST NOT be re-litigated or questioned:

### 1. {{Decision Title}}

<!-- Example: "Single-Tenant Deployment Model" -->
{{Description of the architectural decision and why it was made.}}

Do NOT recommend:
- {{Alternative approach that should not be suggested}}
- {{Another alternative to avoid}}

### 2. {{Decision Title}}

{{Description of another locked decision.}}

Do NOT recommend:
- {{Alternatives to avoid}}

### 3. Greenfield Development (Remove if N/A)

<!-- Include this if your project has no production users yet -->
No production users exist. Breaking changes are acceptable. Do NOT:
- Add `[Obsolete]` attributes or deprecation warnings
- Create backwards-compatibility adapters
- Maintain deprecated code paths

## Critical Patterns

<!--
  Document key patterns Claude should follow and anti-patterns to avoid.
  Include specific scenarios that commonly cause issues.
-->

### Before Making Architectural Recommendations

1. Read `docs/CLAUDE/ARCHITECTURE.md` FIRST
2. Understand the deployment model and key constraints
3. If user challenges analysis, re-examine assumptions - don't defend incorrect analysis

### When Tests Fail

1. Check target frameworks/versions match
2. Get the actual error message - don't debug from status codes alone
3. See debugging checklist in `docs/CLAUDE/DEVELOPMENT.md`

### {{Domain-Specific Pattern}}

<!-- Add patterns specific to your domain -->
{{Description of important pattern}}

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Version |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Backend | {{e.g., ASP.NET Core}} | {{e.g., 8.0}} |
| Frontend | {{e.g., React, Blazor}} | |
| Database | {{e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL Server}} | |
| {{Other}} | {{Technology}} | |

## Project Structure

<!--
  Show your project's directory structure.
  Focus on the main components Claude needs to understand.
-->

```

├── src/
│   ├── {{Project}}.Domain/        # Entities, no dependencies
│   ├── {{Project}}.Application/   # Services, interfaces, DTOs
│   ├── {{Project}}.Infrastructure/# Database, external services

```

## Quick Commands

<!--
  Common commands Claude will need to run.
  Adjust for your build system (npm, dotnet, cargo, etc.)
-->

```bash
# Build
{{BUILD_COMMAND}}

# Test
{{TEST_COMMAND}}

# Database migrations (if applicable)
{{MIGRATION_COMMAND}}
```

## Resources

<!--
  Link to reference documents within your project.
  These should be files Claude can read for deeper context.
-->

- `docs/CLAUDE/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Database schema, deployment model, entity patterns
- `docs/CLAUDE/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Lessons learned, debugging checklists, operational patterns
- `docs/CLAUDE/API-REFERENCE.md` - API endpoints, request/response formats
<!-- Add project-specific references as needed -->
