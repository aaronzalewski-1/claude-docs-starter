## Synthesis Methodologies

### Narrative Synthesis

**Purpose**: Integrate findings through textual narrative.

| Step | Activities |
|------|------------|
| 1. Preliminary synthesis | Tabulate findings, group similar |
| 2. Explore relationships | Compare, contrast, find patterns |
| 3. Assess robustness | Test synthesis against evidence |
| 4. Develop narrative | Write integrated account |

**Best for**: Diverse study designs, complex interventions.

### Thematic Synthesis

**Purpose**: Generate themes from qualitative findings.

| Step | Activities |
|------|------------|
| 1. Code text | Line-by-line coding |
| 2. Develop descriptive themes | Group codes |
| 3. Generate analytical themes | Interpret, abstract |

**Best for**: Qualitative studies, understanding experiences.

### Framework Synthesis

**Purpose**: Map findings to existing theoretical framework.

| Step | Activities |
|------|------------|
| 1. Select framework | Choose organizing structure |
| 2. Code to framework | Map data to categories |
| 3. Chart findings | Create matrix |
| 4. Interpret | Analyze patterns |

**Best for**: Policy-relevant questions, known frameworks.

### Meta-Ethnography

**Purpose**: Translate qualitative studies into each other.

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Reciprocal translation** | Studies say similar things |
| **Refutational translation** | Studies contradict |
| **Line of argument** | New interpretation from whole |

**Best for**: Related qualitative studies.

### Realist Synthesis

**Purpose**: Understand what works, for whom, in what circumstances.

| Component | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Context** | What conditions? |
| **Mechanism** | How does it work? |
| **Outcome** | What happens? |

**Best for**: Complex interventions, policy questions.

## Theme Identification Techniques

### Inductive Approach

Start with data, let themes emerge:

1. **Immersion**: Read all sources multiple times
2. **Initial coding**: Note interesting observations
3. **Searching for themes**: Group codes into potential themes
4. **Reviewing themes**: Check against data
5. **Defining themes**: Name and describe
6. **Producing report**: Write synthesis

### Deductive Approach

Start with framework, code to categories:

1. **Select framework**: Choose theoretical lens
2. **Define categories**: Establish coding scheme
3. **Code data**: Apply categories to sources
4. **Analyze patterns**: Look within and across categories
5. **Interpret**: Explain findings through framework

### Abductive Approach

Iterate between data and theory:

1. **Initial observation**: Note surprising findings
2. **Generate hypothesis**: Possible explanation
3. **Test against data**: Does it fit?
4. **Refine**: Adjust explanation
5. **Repeat**: Until coherent account

## Relationship Mapping

### Relationship Types

| Type | Symbol | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Supports** | → | Evidence that A leads to/enables B |
| **Contradicts** | ⊗ | A and B are incompatible |
| **Correlates** | ↔ | A and B occur together |
| **Precedes** | >> | A must happen before B |
| **Enables** | ⊃ | A makes B possible |
| **Requires** | ⊂ | B cannot occur without A |
| **Moderates** | ∿ | C changes the A-B relationship |
| **Mediates** | →○→ | A causes C which causes B |

### Mapping Techniques

**Concept Map:**
```
Central Concept
    ├── Related Concept 1
    │       ├── Sub-concept
    │       └── Sub-concept
    └── Related Concept 2
            └── Sub-concept
```

**Relationship Matrix:**
| | Concept A | Concept B | Concept C |
|---|---|---|---|
| Concept A | - | supports | contradicts |
| Concept B | | - | enables |
| Concept C | | | - |

**Causal Loop Diagram:**
```
Variable A →(+)→ Variable B
    ↑               │
    └───(-)─────────┘
```

## Integration Strategies

### Strategy 1: Chronological Integration

**When to use**: Understanding evolution of knowledge.

| Era | Key Developments | Paradigm |
|-----|------------------|----------|
| [Period] | [Events/findings] | [Dominant view] |

### Strategy 2: Conceptual Integration

**When to use**: Building theoretical understanding.

```
Overarching Concept
├── Dimension 1
│   ├── Aspect A (Source 1, 3)
│   └── Aspect B (Source 2)
├── Dimension 2
│   └── Aspect C (Source 1, 2, 3)
└── Dimension 3
    └── Aspect D (Source 3)
```

### Strategy 3: Methodological Integration

**When to use**: Combining quant and qual evidence.

| Aspect | Quantitative Findings | Qualitative Findings | Integration |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| [Topic] | [Stats] | [Themes] | [Combined insight] |

### Strategy 4: Stakeholder Integration

**When to use**: Multiple perspectives on same phenomenon.

| Perspective | View | Evidence |
|-------------|------|----------|
| [Group 1] | [Position] | [Sources] |
| [Group 2] | [Position] | [Sources] |
| [Synthesis] | [Integration] | |

## Gap Analysis

### Types of Gaps

| Gap Type | Description | Significance |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Evidence gap** | No studies address question | Prevents conclusion |
| **Population gap** | Some groups unstudied | Limits generalizability |
| **Setting gap** | Context not examined | Unknown applicability |
| **Outcome gap** | Important outcomes missed | Incomplete picture |
| **Mechanism gap** | How it works unknown | Limits intervention design |
| **Implementation gap** | Theory but no practice | Unknown feasibility |

### Gap Identification Process

1. **What questions remain unanswered?**
2. **What populations are underrepresented?**
3. **What settings haven't been studied?**
4. **What outcomes weren't measured?**
5. **What mechanisms are unclear?**
6. **What isn't being implemented?**

| Moderate | 0.7 | Some limitations, adequate sample |
| Low | 0.3 | Significant limitations, small sample |
| Very Low | 0.1 | Major flaws, include with caution |

### Weight by Evidence Type

| Evidence | Weight | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Systematic review | 1.0 | Synthesized evidence |
| RCT | 0.9 | Strong causation evidence |
| Cohort | 0.7 | Temporal sequence |
| Cross-sectional | 0.5 | Association only |
| Case study | 0.3 | Limited generalizability |
| Expert opinion | 0.2 | No direct evidence |
