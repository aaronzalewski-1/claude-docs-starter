## Business Claim Verification

### Market Size Claims

| Claim Type | Verification Method | Red Flags |
|------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **TAM figures** | Cross-reference multiple analyst reports | Single source, round numbers |
| **Growth rates** | Check methodology, historical accuracy | Extrapolation from short period |
| **Market share** | Verify calculation method | Self-reported, cherry-picked segment |
| **Industry statistics** | Find primary research source | No methodology disclosed |

**Questions to Ask**:
- Where does this number come from?
- What's included/excluded in the definition?
- Over what time period?
- What assumptions drive the projection?

### Competitive Claims

| Claim | Verification Approach |
|-------|----------------------|
| "We're #1 in X" | By what metric? In what segment? |
| "X% market share" | How is market defined? Source? |
| "Fastest growing" | Compared to whom? What period? |
| "Industry leader" | By whose assessment? |
| "Enterprise-grade" | What certifications? Which enterprises? |

### Financial Claims

| Claim Type | Skeptic Questions |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Revenue growth** | MRR vs ARR vs bookings? Net or gross? |
| **Profitability** | GAAP or non-GAAP? What's excluded? |
| **Unit economics** | Fully loaded CAC? Blended or cohorted LTV? |
| **Runway** | At current or projected burn? |
| **Valuation** | Comparable transactions? Methodology? |

## Vendor and Partner Claim Verification

### Technology Vendor Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Suggests |
|----------|------------------|
| "AI-powered" without specifics | Marketing buzzword |
| "Enterprise-ready" without customers | Aspirational, not proven |
| "Unlimited scale" | No system is unlimited |
| "99.99% uptime" without SLA | Promise without commitment |
| "Military-grade security" | Meaningless marketing term |
| "Industry-leading" | Self-proclaimed, verify |

### Vendor Verification Checklist

| Claim Area | Verification |
|------------|--------------|
| **Customer logos** | Can they provide references? |
| **Case studies** | Measurable outcomes or vanity metrics? |
| **Performance claims** | Independent benchmarks? |
| **Integration claims** | Certified or just "works with"? |
| **Support claims** | SLA terms? Response time data? |
| **Roadmap items** | Written commitment or "planned"? |

### Reference Check Questions

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| How long have you used this? | New vs battle-tested |
| What problems did you encounter? | Every solution has issues |
| Would you choose it again? | True satisfaction indicator |
| What's the total cost? | Hidden costs emerge |
| How's the support? | Post-sale reality check |

## Common Business Assumption Fallacies

### Pattern 1: Survivorship Bias

**Indicator**: "Successful companies do X, so we should too"

**Problem**: Only looking at winners, ignoring failures who did same thing.

**Questions**:
- How many companies tried this and failed?
- What else did successful companies have?
- Is this correlation or causation?

**Examples**:
- "Apple didn't do market research" → Many failures didn't either
- "Amazon was unprofitable for years" → Most unprofitable startups fail

### Pattern 2: Planning Fallacy

**Indicator**: Timeline and cost estimates without buffer

**Problem**: Systematic underestimation of time and resources.

**Questions**:
- What similar projects took longer/cost more?
- What could go wrong?
- What's the outside view probability?

**Reality Checks**:
- Add 50-100% to time estimates
- Add 20-50% to cost estimates
- List 10 things that could go wrong

### Pattern 3: Confirmation Bias

**Indicator**: Evidence supports existing belief too perfectly

**Questions**:
- What evidence would change our mind?
- What does the opposing view say?
- Are we seeking disconfirming evidence?
- Who disagrees and why?

### Pattern 4: Appeal to Authority

**Indicator**: "Expert/successful person says X"

**Questions**:
- Is this their area of expertise?
- What's their track record on this specific topic?
- Do other experts agree?
- What's their potential bias?

**Common Examples**:
- VC advice (often contradictory)
- Successful founder advice (survivorship bias)
- Consultant recommendations (incentive alignment?)

### Pattern 5: "Everyone Knows"

**Indicator**: Unexamined conventional wisdom

**Questions**:
- Where did this belief originate?
- Is there data supporting it?
- Has context changed since it became "known"?
- What if the opposite were true?

**Examples**:
- "First mover advantage" → Often wrong
- "You need VC to scale" → Many paths exist
- "Enterprise sales needs a sales team" → PLG exists

### Pattern 6: Projection Bias

**Indicator**: Assuming others think/act like us

**Questions**:
- Have we talked to actual customers?
- What do non-users say?
- What does the data show, not intuition?

## Data Quality Assessment

### Source Credibility for Business Data

| Source Type | Trust Level | Caveats |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **SEC Filings** | Very High | Legally required accuracy |
| **Audited Financials** | High | For public or funded companies |
| **Industry Analysts (Gartner, etc.)** | Medium-High | Methodology varies |
| **Trade Publications** | Medium | May have advertiser influence |
| **Surveys** | Medium-Low | Sample bias, self-reporting |
| **Vendor Claims** | Low | Obvious bias |
| **Press Releases** | Very Low | Marketing material |

### Survey Data Red Flags

| Red Flag | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Small sample size | Not representative |
| Self-selected respondents | Bias toward strong opinions |
| Leading questions | Predetermined answers |
| No methodology disclosed | Cannot assess quality |
| Sponsored by interested party | Potential bias |

### Benchmark Data Verification

| Check | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Sample composition | Are comparables actually comparable? |
| Time period | When was data collected? |
| Definition consistency | Same metrics measured same way? |
| Industry segment | Too broad or specific? |
| Geographic scope | Regional vs global differences? |

## Business Model Assumption Testing

### Revenue Model Assumptions

| Assumption | Skeptic Questions |
|------------|-------------------|
| "Customers will pay $X" | Based on what evidence? Willingness to pay research? |
| "We'll convert Y% to paid" | Industry benchmarks? Early data? |
| "Churn will be Z%" | Compared to similar products? |
| "Users will refer others" | What's the actual K-factor? |
| "Enterprise will pay more" | Sales cycle? Support cost? |

### Cost Model Assumptions

| Assumption | Skeptic Questions |
|------------|-------------------|
| "Costs will decrease at scale" | Which costs? By how much? When? |
| "Automation will reduce headcount" | Implementation cost? Timeline? |
| "We can do it cheaper" | Why haven't others? What's different? |
| "Variable costs only" | What fixed costs are hidden? |

### Growth Model Assumptions

| Assumption | Skeptic Questions |
|------------|-------------------|
| "Market is growing X%" | Source? Sustainable? |
| "We'll capture Y% share" | Against what competition? |
| "Viral growth coefficient" | Measured or assumed? |
| "Network effects kick in at Z" | Evidence from similar products? |
